# Estimating-San-Francisco-House-Prices-Using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to estimate the premium people pay for a house in a given zip code and how various factors influence house prices in San Francisco County by leveraging scraped data from online listings and regression models. We performed data processing and feature engineering techniques to prepare the data for modeling. We experimented with several machine learning techniques, including random forest, gradient-boosted regressor, and neural network, and found that linear regression provided the best balance between predictive performance and interpretability. Using our linear regression model, we estimated the premium people pay for different zip codes, finding that people are paying a premium of $1.8Mn to live in zip code 94123 (Highest) compared to zip code 94014 (lowest), for a similar configuration of house. Our findings offer valuable insights for real estate professionals and potential buyers by leveraging data-driven approaches in estimating premiums. Itâ€™ll help real estate firms in making more precise valuations and therefore reduce the risk of over- or under-valuing properties. This can lead to better decision-making, improved profitability, and increased customer satisfaction.
